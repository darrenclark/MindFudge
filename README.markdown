# About

I was looking for a little project I could do to practice my Ruby, so I decided to write a "family friendly" Brainf**k interpreter, hence calling it MindFudge...

# Requirements

It uses the very awesome gem, [HighLine](http://rubyforge.org/projects/highline/), to read input from the Terminal. You will have to install it before running this script. (`gem install highline`)

# Usage

    $ ruby mindfudge.rb examples/hello.mf
or

    $ ruby mindfudge.rb -c "<some code here>"

I have included two examples (stolen from Wikipedia) in the `examples/` directory.

The Wikipedia page on the language is very helpful. [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)
